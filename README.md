# memory-tool
This is a simple python script designed for use within terminal or command prompt.

The idea was to create something to help me memorize shorter bodies of text (i.e. 1-2 sentences).

It can take larger amounts of text but I imagine the typing would get pretty tedious.

One bug that I have not yet fixed is that if you paste in some text with a different ascii apostrophe or other character
not supported by your terminal you will run into some problems/confusion. Other than that I have found it to be very helpful!

run it with

```
python3 memorizer.py
```
